# Fractal-Algo

This repository contains the implementation of an algorithm to calculate the **Fractal Dimension** of square images. The project plays a crucial role in studying **emotion recognition** by quantifying different human emotions and their intensities. 

## üöÄ Overview

The goal of this project is to compute the **Fractal Dimension** of square images and use it to quantify **7 human emotions**, along with their intensities (scale 1-6) and viewing angles (-45¬∞, 0¬∞, +45¬∞). The primary application of this algorithm is to dive deep into **emotion recognition** research, potentially helping individuals with conditions like **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** in the future.

## üìä Project Details

In this project, we compute the **Fractal Dimension** of NxN square images, aiming to study how the dimension correlates with different emotions. By analyzing various images from the **Indian Affective Picture Database (IAPD)** at **IIT Kanpur**, the algorithm provides insights into how different emotions, their intensities, and viewing angles affect the fractal dimension.

### Applications
- **Emotion Recognition:**  
  This algorithm quantifies 7 human emotions based on specific features in the images.
  
- **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):**  
  In the future, we plan to apply this research in ASD studies, where emotion recognition plays a critical role in improving communication and behavioral therapy.

- **Machine Learning Integration:**  
  Future work aims to automate the process by training an AI/ML model using data from the IAPD to further refine the emotional analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Input:** Square NxN images from the IAPD, with various viewing angles (-45¬∞, 0¬∞, +45¬∞).
2. **Fractal Dimension Calculation:** The algorithm computes the fractal dimension to quantify the emotional intensity of the image.
3. **Emotion Quantification:** The calculated fractal dimension is used to estimate the intensity (scale 1-6) of 7 distinct emotions captured in the image.

## üöß Future Improvements

- **Automating the Process:**  
  Plan to automate the fractal dimension analysis using **AI** and **Machine Learning**.
  
- **ML Model Training:**  
  Train models using IAPD images for more accurate emotion recognition.

- **ASD Applications:**  
  Contribute to the field of Autism Spectrum Disorder by using fractal dimension analysis to aid in emotion recognition studies and therapy.
