# Fractal-Algo

You can check the whole project from this google Colab Link : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14BnB0KYwzwwi0fQdyq1Eekzl2qOR9ubG?authuser=2#scrollTo=QMZTztww4eu2

Actually, here we are calculating the Fractal Dimension of an square image. Mainly we are using it to quantify 7 human emotions along with thier intensities (scale 1-6) and viewing angle (-45, 0 ,+ 45 degrees).

Using this we can dive deep into the emotion recognition research and studies and draw crucial conclusions.
Further in future, we aim to automate the whole process using AI, and train the model using ML from the Indian Affective picture Database images (IAPD - IIT Kanpur) and try to help people with ASD - Autism Spectrum Disorder, and can also contribute in related fields and areas.

Thank you
